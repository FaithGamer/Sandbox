- Spent the day reworking the signal system. 
I discovered that std::function can wrap a call to a member function along with the object to call the function upon.
I learned a bit more about variadic function, and how one can store an undefined amount of arguments with tuple, then call this function
by "opening" the tuple with the help of std::index_sequence
-Started working on worker thread, to send tasks to various thread.

- Implemented my own delegate, based on function pointers that can take free function or member function thanks to type-erasing
I spent a lot of time trying to have multiple variadic template class with the goal to give the ability to my delegate to fill only a couple of the requiered
parameters but in vain.
Nevertheless the delegate can now call function either with arguments provided with the delegate constructor, or at the time of the call.
- So now signals use the Delegate instead of std::function, but I still need to find how to make the signals be able to send reference or pointers as SignalType
