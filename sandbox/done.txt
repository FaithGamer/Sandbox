April


10
- Fixed ImGui processing event with io.WanCaptureMouse/Keyboard
- Inputs creation is now only accessible through InputMap, and InputMap creation only through Inputs
- ForEachComponent improved with lambda/free function, and default gameworld

16
-Improved the batch renderer to take custom shader/render target/stencil mode, with batch generated on purpose.

20

-Render layers and Offscreen render layers almost implemented.
Every layer will be drawn if he has been used during a batch. left to do: every offscreen layer should be bound in the appropriate uniform location

may

13

-Renderer2D can render on specific target
-Render layers can take a specific screen space.

september

22

- Vec: to string

24

- InputMap: Event can pass through 


26
-fixed bug with rendering sprite

27
-optimization for non-moving sprite
-fixed: layer works again (one batch was doubled, GetBatchId was laways returning 0, glViewport wasn't used in RdnerTexture->Bind)

28
-implemented a shader for neat pixel art rendering. But it decrease the performances on large amount of entities.
could be nice to use this shader only for static elements, since (fast) moving sprites distortion are less visible.

octobre

1

-Camera Screen To World position
-Entity is now a simple handle, no more pointer

3

- started working on particle

4

- fixed particle position instance
- particle start emitting right away when constructed
