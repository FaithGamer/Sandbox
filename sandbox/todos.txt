- to create an input, only go through an input map, same for InputMap, create it from Inputs

- threaded BatchRendering
- bindings serialization (include cereal in project)


-material instead of just shader

-resource id for shader/stencil/ ->"render mode option batch id" 



-add math to pch



-optimize the particle system by recording the prevOffset and nextOffset for each element in the particle array
-test if listener that are null are properly discardded by signaler
-easing
-state machine like in csharp
-some delegate are "eating" the parameters lvalue
-renderer2D hardcode it's default shader to not rely on asset manager
-engine settings from json

big tasks:

- assets and asset manager


- animator for transform and sprite render

- rendering line (batching ?)
- sound
- fixed aspect ratio for layers
- transform parenting


Asset Manager:

-I wanna have all the assets loaded when the engine launches.
-create any asset ref with it's path
-texture can be cut into sprites
-json file in the same folder as the texture, with the same name, give the rules of cutting
-asset manager read these json files and create sprites accordingly, create a default one if there's none.

accessible asset type:

config
sprite
material
audioclip

underlying asset:

texture
shader
