- to create an input, only go through an input map, same for InputMap, create it from Inputs
- threaded BatchRendering
-material instead of just shader
-resource id for shader/stencil/ ->"render mode option batch id" 



-test if correction of ill formed texture import settings works and overwrite or not the spritesheet and vice versa
-optimize the particle system by recording the prevOffset and nextOffset for each element in the particle array
-test if listener that are null are properly discardded by signaler
-easing
-state machine like in csharp
-some delegate are "eating" the parameters lvalue
-renderer2D hardcode it's default shader to not rely on asset manager
-engine settings from json

big tasks:

- transform parenting
- fixed aspect ratio for layers
- animator for transform and sprite render
- 2D physics, raycasting, shape casting.
- rendering line (batching ?)
- sound
