- to create an input, only go through an input map, same for InputMap, create it from Inputs
- consider getting rid of singleton and instead just using Systems that we can easily acces with system::get
- threaded BatchRendering
-material instead of just shader
-resource id for shader/stencil/ ->"render mode option batch id" 
-test if correction of ill formed texture import settings works and overwrite or not the spritesheet and vice versa
-optimize the particle system by recording the prevOffset and nextOffset for each element in the particle array
-test if listener that are null are properly discardded by signaler
-easing
-state machine like in csharp
-some delegate are "eating" the parameters lvalue
-renderer2D hard-code it's default shaders to not rely on asset manager
-engine settings from json
-line renderer width take transform into account
-enable 

big tasks:

- rendering line (batching ?)
- fixed aspect ratio for layers
- animator for transform and sprite render
- collisions

- sound

line:

-line width control
-vertex position scale with camera ppu
-line width take transform and aspect ratio into consideration
-butt
-different width along the line (each point ? or interpolated across the total length ?)
-antialiasing
