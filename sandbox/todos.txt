- to create an input, only go through an input map, same for InputMap, create it from Inputs
- consider getting rid of singleton and instead just using Systems that we can easily acces with system::get
- threaded BatchRendering
-material instead of just shader
-resource id for shader/stencil/ ->"render mode option batch id" 
-test if correction of ill formed texture import settings works and overwrite or not the spritesheet and vice versa
-optimize the particle system by recording the prevOffset and nextOffset for each element in the particle array
-test if listener that are null are properly discardded by signaler
-easing
-state machine like in csharp
-some delegate are "eating" the parameters lvalue
-renderer2D hard-code it's default shaders to not rely on asset manager
-engine settings from json
-line renderer width take transform into account
-line antialiasing ?
-test line renderer reverse (must reverse width aswell i think)

big tasks:

- fixed aspect ratio for layers
- animator for transform and sprite render
- collisions

2D physics, raycasting, shape casting:

-remove cute
- create callbacks class for raycasting
- Physics singleton to invoke raycast and hold b2World 
	-RaycastAll(include layermask)
	-RaycastClosest(include layermask)
	-

-separate collider component from body component?
-CollideableObject must be moved with both transform&body
static Physics::MoveBody(entity& )
{
}

-fixture must have entityId as userdata, so collider must have too,
-use OnAddComponent callback to automatically add entityId to the collider
-test the onAddComponent/On remove component callbacks
- Collider (component)
	Collider.AddShape(1)
	{
	m_body.addFixture(1)
	}
- CircleShape
- BoxShape
- PolygonShape
