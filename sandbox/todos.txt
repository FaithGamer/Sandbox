- to create an input, only go through an input map, same for InputMap, create it from Inputs
- consider getting rid of singleton and instead just using Systems that we can easily acces with system::get
- threaded BatchRendering
-material instead of just shader
-resource id for shader/stencil/ ->"render mode option batch id" 
-test if correction of ill formed texture import settings works and overwrite or not the spritesheet and vice versa
-optimize the particle system by recording the prevOffset and nextOffset for each element in the particle array
-test if listener that are null are properly discardded by signaler
-easing
-state machine like in csharp
-some delegate are "eating" the parameters lvalue
-renderer2D hard-code it's default shaders to not rely on asset manager
-engine settings from json
-line renderer width take transform into account
-line antialiasing ?
-test line renderer reverse (must reverse width aswell i think)
-vec operator take references
-test if we can draw a line between two sprites (Z depth)
-rename spriteRender to SpriteRenderer
-Add mouse position from systems and camera

-transform optimize the matrix computation for children
-try computing matrix in shader
- move bitmask from physics to core
-class for random instead of free function and namespace, so we can actually set the seed
-

BIG TASKS:

- semi transparency doesnt work on custom render layer
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24346585/opengl-render-to-texture-with-partial-transparancy-translucency-and-then-rende
- fixed aspect ratio for render layers
- animator for transform and sprite render
- collisions
- tile map
- path finding
- destroy children entities -> transform system

PHYSICS:

- remove debug collider render if component body is removed without ldeleting entity
- circle radius is in fact diameter
- add distance in every overlap

- raycast with use direction + distance
-add Body raycast/overlap that ignores itslef
-implement polygon
-test enable/disable DrawColliders

-physics must have filters

-check if collision render wire draw correctly
-check if aspect ratio for wire is needed

BREAKING BUG:

-when deleting entity with body and debug transform enabled: transform m_haveParent is true but parent have no transform component
I think this is because the wirerenderdebug is created OnUpdate and out of sync with the thread of love colony.
fix this by enabling wireRenderDebug to be manually called for wire render creation
